# Lists
# A list is a collection of items but unlike vectors, lists can contain any mixture of elements of any type. Lists can even contain other lists.

# You can use the list() function to crerate a list:

L <- list("a", 1, 2.5, TRUE)
L

# Named lists
# Lists can also use names by creating key/value pairs to assign a name to each element within the list. You can then access an element within the list by using the element's name/key:

a_list <- list("San Francisco"= 1, "Santa Clara" = 2, "San Jose" = 3)
a_list
