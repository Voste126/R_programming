### Universal (built-in) functions that can be applied to vectors

# Create a vector "v":
v = c(25, 9, 16, 4)

# Return the mean value of the vector
mean(v)

# Return the square root of each value in the vector
sqrt(v)

# Return the maximum value in the vector
max(v)

# Return the smallest value in the vector
min(v)

# Return the sum of the values in the vector
sum(v)

# Sort the values in a vector in ascending order
sort(v)

# Sort the values in a vector in descending order
sort(v, decreasing=TRUE)

# Count the frequency of occurrence for each element in a vector:
table(c(20,30,50,20,40,10,40,20))
